## PhonePe Pulse Visualization Project

This project aims to develop a user-friendly tool to visualize and explore PhonePe Pulse data using Streamlit and Plotly.

### Features

The PhonePe Pulse Visualization tool includes the following features:

* **Interactive dashboard:** The dashboard allows users to select different parameters and visualize the data accordingly. For example, users can select a specific time period, state, or merchant category to see how the data changes over time or across different regions and categories.
* **Variety of visualizations:** The tool supports a variety of visualizations, including bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and geo maps. This allows users to explore the data in different ways and identify different trends and patterns.
* **Drill-down capabilities:** The tool allows users to drill down into the data to get more detailed insights. For example, users can click on a state on the geo map to see a breakdown of the transactions in that state by merchant category.

### How to use

To use the PhonePe Pulse Visualization tool, simply clone the GitHub repository and run the `main.py` file. This will start a web app that you can access in your browser.

The dashboard is divided into two sections:

* **Sidebar:** The sidebar allows you to select different parameters to filter the data.
* **Main area:** The main area displays the visualizations based on the selected parameters.

You can interact with the visualizations by clicking on them and hovering over them. For example, you can click on a bar in a bar chart to see the corresponding value.
